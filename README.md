# Skin Cancer Detection

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- The purpose of this project is to build multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network.

- The need for this project emerged from significant revenue losses due to decreased mobility amidst the pandemic. The project aims to facilitate strategic business planning to accelerate revenue growth post-pandemic.

- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).


## Technologies Used
- Python - 3.7
- Pandas - 1.1.5
- NumPy - 1.19.5
- TensorFlow - 2.4
- Keras - 2.4
- Augmentor - 0.2.8



## Conclusions
- CNN model achieved a high accuracy in detection of melanoma.
- custom model  provide insights into the model architecture and its performance.
- Demonstrates the potential of AI in medical diagnosis
- Data augmentation significantly improved the model's performance and helped in handling class imbalances.
